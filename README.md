INTRODUCTION:

      Most of the industry applications create pollution in the air and the vehicle emissions are also dangerous to the health of the people. In the developing countries, air pollution is severe in most of the areas. Most of the air quality measuring systems uses air quality index to tell the people about the air quality of their location. The primary objective of the system is to analyze and visualize air quality from the real time sensor data. The proposed system analyses four critical air pollutants which are Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) , Sulphur dioxide (SO2) , SPM and RSPM are the most widespread health threats.
      One of the worldâ€™s unembellished environment issues is air pollution. World Health Organization (WHO) said in its report that, in developing countries there are more than 2 million people died annually due to air pollution in India, China and Pakistan. Also, air pollution causes health issues around the word and 7 million people died annually. Most of the industries generate polluted air because of material processing and other industry related works. Urban areas are in danger to live due to air pollution. Air pollution is due to the lack of knowledge and carelessness of the people. Also, air may pollute due to natural calamity such as flooding, rocks collapse and gas leakage which causes severe health problems. The diseases such as heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, chronic disease and some types of cancers are due to air pollution.The daily quality of air is measured with the help of Air Quality Index (AQI).This measure indicates the cleanliness of the air around us. AQI mainly focuses on the air quality in quantitative measures and also tells the types of health issues due to different pollution level. The air quality standard was developed by EPA and the clean air act indicates that there are four major air pollutants such as , SPM, SO2, RSPM and NO2.
      Monitoring air pollution has become increasingly critical due to the rising levels of pollution. Air tracking has grown to be a significant task for measuring continuous levels of air contaminants in the environment. It is essential to monitor air pollution levels regularly to take appropriate measures and control its impact on human health and the environment.
